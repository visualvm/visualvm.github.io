        <p>VisualVM is a tool for visualizing data sources. By default, it visualizes
        the following types of data sources&#8212;applications, hosts, snapshots, core dumps,
        heap dumps, and thread dumps. These data sources are visualized in VisualVM so
        that they can be monitored for purposes of analysis, management, and troubleshooting.
        
        <p>In this tutorial you will be
        introduced to the VisualVM APIs so that you can provide additional
        features to VisualVM. Principally, you will be shown how to get
        started using them and be given pointers for further resources, such
        as templates and samples. 
        
        <p>In general, there are two types of reasons
        why you would want to extend VisualVM:
        
        <ul>
        <p><li><b>Tool-Centric.</b> In this scenario, you have a monitoring
        or management tool that
        you want to make available to VisualVM. For example, maybe you have
        a tool that shows an application's threads or processing speed in a
        new and interesting way. In this case, you would create a plugin
        that makes your tool available to VisualVM via new tabs and menu
        items, so that VisualVM users can
        benefit from the feature set provided by your tool. 
        <p><li><b>Application-Centric.</b> In this scenario, you
        have an application with specific monitoring/management needs. For
        example, if your application is a deployment server, you might want to 
        give users a graphic overview of the applications that are deployed
        to that server. In this case, you would need to introduce a new type
        of application to VisualVM. By default, all of your applications will be treated
        in the same default way and if, therefore, your application has one or more
        unique characteristics, and you want those characteristics to be supported
        in VisualVM, you would need to provide a plugin for a unique type
        of application in this way.

        <h2 class="tutorial"><a name="entry"></a>Introducing the VisualVM Entry Points</h2>
        
        <p>Entry points into VisualVM fall into the
        following categories:
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Tab extension.</b> By default, VisualVM provides tabs
            with labels such as "Overview", "Monitor", and "Threads". You can
            create new tabs just like these. Optionally, your own tabs can be
            extendable so that others can plug subtabs into your tabs.
            Your tabs can either be available
            for all data sources in VisualVM or to specific types of data sources.
            <li><b>Subtab extension.</b> Within tabs
            such as those listed above, you can provide
            new subtabs. However, this is only possible if the tab has been
            defined to be "pluggable", which is explained below. The following tabs are all pluggable:
            "Overview", "Monitor", "Threads", "Heap Dump", and "Host". When you create a new subtab, 
            you can specify its position in relation to the other subtabs within the tab.
            Subtabs can either be available for all data sources or for specific data
            sources.
            <li><b>Menu extension.</b> A data source, and its subnodes,
            can have one or more menu items added to their contextual menus.
            <li><b>Application type extension.</b> By default, all applications
            visualized in VisualVM are treated equally, that is, they all have the same icons
            and tabs, except if a plugin is provided to provide additional functionality.
            You might also want to provide functionality for a specific application,
            which means that you would need to define a new application type.
            You can do this to do 
            something as simple as provide a distinguishing icon for a
            running instance of your application. Alternatively, you might
            want to provide a lot of functionality, including graphs, to show
            the processing of your specific application.
            <li><b>Data source extension.</b> The "Application" data source is only
            one of the types of data sources that can be monitored and managed
            in VisualVM. Another of the data sources is the "Host" data source,
            which lets you monitor and manage local and remote hosts.
            You might want to create new data sources, in situations where you want to
            monitor and manage a type of data source that VisualVM does not cater
            for by default.
        </ul>    
        
        <p>A visual representation of the entry points into VisualVM:
        
        <p><p><img src="{{ '/images/big-entrypoints-diagram.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" border="1"/>
        
        <p>Entry points into VisualVM are implemented via the factory
        pattern. In that light, the main VisualVM APIs are as follows:
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Tabs</b>
            <br><tt>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.DataSourceViewProvider</tt>
            <br>/<tt>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.DataSourceView</tt>
            <p>To make your tabs extendable, the following API must be extended,
            instead of com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.DataSourceViewProvider:
            <br><tt>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.PluggableDataSourceViewProvider</tt>
            <li><b>Subtabs</b>
            <br><tt>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.DataSourceViewPluginProvider</tt>
            <br>/<tt>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.DataSourceViewPlugin</tt>
            <li><b>Menu Items</b>
            <br><tt>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.actions.SingleDataSourceAction</tt>
            <li><b>Application Types</b>
            <br><tt>com.sun.tools.visualvm.application.type.MainClassApplicationTypeFactory</tt>
            <br>/<tt>com.sun.tools.visualvm.application.type.ApplicationType</tt>
            <li><b>Data Sources</b>
            <br><tt>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.model.AbstractModelProvider</tt>
            <br>/<tt>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.datasource.descriptor.DataSourceDescriptor</tt>
            <br>/<tt>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.datasource.DataSource</tt>
        </ul>    
        
        <p><p>The lifecycle of a VisualVM plugin is determined by a <tt>ModuleInstall</tt> class,
        which comes from the NetBeans APIs. Whenever you implement a new entry point into
        VisualVM, you need to provide code for registering and unregistering the entry point
        implementation. The relevant initialization code must be provided in the <tt>ModuleInstall</tt>
        class. When the plugin is loaded into VisualVM, the <tt>ModuleInstall.restored</tt>
        method is the first method that is called from your plugin. That is the method
        that should initialize the entry points. When the plugin is uninstalled, or when VisualVM
        closes down, the plugin's entry points need to be deregistered, from the
        <tt>ModuleInstall.uninstalled</tt> method. You will be shown some typical
        registration/deregistration code in the "Hello World" scenario that follows.
        
        <h2><a name="preparing"></a>Preparing to Extend VisualVM</h2>
        
        <p>When you are planning to extend VisualVM, you need to
        do the following:
        
        <ul>
            
            <li><b>Install JDK 7.</b> VisualVM 1.3.7+ itself runs on JDK 7, even
            though it can monitor and manage applications running
            on earlier versions of the JDK. The plugins that you
            create need to therefore also make use of JDK 7 and
            not any earlier version of the JDK.
            
            <li><b>Install NetBeans IDE 6.x.</b> Though you are free to use
            any editor or IDE to develop VisualVM plugins, NetBeans IDE
            is optimized for plugin development for VisualVM. For example,
            the VisualVM plugin project structure, as well as several
            useful templates, can be generated by NetBeans IDE. At the
            time of writing, similar code generating features for VisualVM
            are not supported by other IDEs.
            
            <li><b>Register VisualVM in NetBeans IDE.</b> You will be
            building your VisualVM plugins against VisualVM, so that its
            plugins (and the APIs exposed by those plugins) are available
            to your own plugins. When you put the binary of VisualVM in the
            NetBeans Platform Manager, you will enable NetBeans IDE to compile
            your plugin against VisualVM. The VisualVM's APIs are then available 
            to your plugin. Under the Tools menu, choose NetBeans Platform
            Manager, and then browse to the root folder of your VisualVM
            installation. Click Next and then click Finish. Later, when you create
            a VisualVM plugin project, you will be able to specify that the
            plugin should be built against the VisualVM binary that you
            registered above.
            
            <li><b>Get the VisualVM Javadoc.</b> API documentation for VisualVM 1.3.7
            can be found <a href="nonav/apidocs/137/index.html">here</a>.</li>
            
        </ul>
        
        <h2><a name="hello"></a>Creating a "Hello World" Plugin</h2>
        
        <p>Now, we'll say "Hello World". We will create a new tab that looks as follows:
        
        <p><p><img src="{{ '/images/final-result.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" border="1"/>
        
        <p>There will be no data in our tab, we'll simply create it and add 
        some placeholders for content. 
        
        <ol>
            <p><li>In NetBeans IDE, choose File &gt; New Project and then
            choose NetBeans Modules &gt; Module. Click Next. Create a new NetBeans module 
            called "HelloVisualVM" and make 
            sure to specify that 
            you want to build against the VisualVM binary that you registered <a href="#preparing">earlier</a>:
            
            <p><p><img src="{{ '/images/new-module-1.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" border="1"/>
            
            <p>Click Next and fill out the next step as follows:
            
            <p><p><img src="{{ '/images/new-module-2.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" border="1"/>
            
            <p>Click Finish.
            
            <p><li>Right-click the "HelloVisualVM" project node and choose New &gt; Other.
            In the New File dialog, use the "Module Installer" wizard, which will create the class that is called
            when the plugin is installed into VisualVM. Here's where you'll find the wizard 
            in the New File dialog:
            
            <p><p><img src="{{ '/images/extend-visualvm-5.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" border="1"/>
            
            <p><li>Once you've completed the wizard, implement the <tt>ModuleInstall.restored</tt> 
            method and the <tt>ModuleInstall.uninstalled</tt> methods as follows:
            
            <p><pre>@Override
public void restored() {
    HelloWorldViewProvider.initialize();
}

@Override
public void uninstalled() {
    HelloWorldViewProvider.unregister();
}</pre>
            
            <p>As you can see, we will define the above two methods in a class called "HelloWorldViewProvider",
            which we will define later. Therefore you can ignore the red error lines, because you
            will create the methods later.
            
            <p><li>Now add a dependency on "VisualVM-Core", which provides the APIs into the VisualVM.
            Do this by right-clicking the project node, choosing "Properties", and then setting
            the dependency in the "Libraries" tab.
            
            <p><li>Create a class called "HelloWorldViewProvider", as follows:
            
            <p><pre>class HelloWorldViewProvider extends DataSourceViewProvider&lt;Application&gt; {

    private static DataSourceViewProvider&lt;Application&gt; instance =  new HelloWorldViewProvider();

    <b>@Override</b>
    public boolean supportsViewFor(Application application) {
        //Always shown:
        return true;
    }

    <b>@Override</b>
    public synchronized DataSourceView createView(final Application application) {
        return new HelloWorldView(application);

    }
    
    static void initialize() {
        DataSourceViewsManager.sharedInstance().addViewProvider(instance, Application.class);
    }
    
    static void unregister() {
        DataSourceViewsManager.sharedInstance().removeViewProvider(instance);
    }
    
}</pre>
            
            <p>By reading the Javadoc that you downloaded <a href="#preparing">earlier</a>, you'll 
            know what the two overridden methods above are all about.
            
            <p><li>Finally, we'll create our <tt>HelloWorldView</tt> class, which is created by our provider above:
            
            <p><pre>class HelloWorldView extends DataSourceView {

    private DataViewComponent dvc;
    //Reusing an image from the sources:
    private static final String IMAGE_PATH = "com/sun/tools/visualvm/coredump/resources/coredump.png"; // NOI18N

    public HelloWorldView(Application application) {
        super(application, "Hello World", new ImageIcon(Utilities.loadImage(IMAGE_PATH, true)).getImage(), 60, false);
    }

    <b>@Override</b>
    protected DataViewComponent createComponent() {

        <b>//Data area for master view:</b>
        JEditorPane generalDataArea = new JEditorPane();
        generalDataArea.setBorder(BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(14, 8, 14, 8));

        <b>//Panel, which we'll reuse in all four of our detail views for this sample:</b>
        JPanel panel = new JPanel();

        <b>//Master view:</b>
        DataViewComponent.MasterView masterView = new DataViewComponent.MasterView
                ("Hello World Overview", null, generalDataArea);

        <b>//Configuration of master view:</b>
        DataViewComponent.MasterViewConfiguration masterConfiguration = 
                new DataViewComponent.MasterViewConfiguration(false);

        <b>//Add the master view and configuration view to the component:</b>
        dvc = new DataViewComponent(masterView, masterConfiguration);

        <b>//Add configuration details to the component, which are the show/hide checkboxes at the top:</b>
        dvc.configureDetailsArea(new DataViewComponent.DetailsAreaConfiguration(
                "Hello World Details 1", true), DataViewComponent.TOP_LEFT);
        dvc.configureDetailsArea(new DataViewComponent.DetailsAreaConfiguration(
                "Hello World Details 2", true), DataViewComponent.TOP_RIGHT);
        dvc.configureDetailsArea(new DataViewComponent.DetailsAreaConfiguration(
                "Hello World Details 3 & 4", true), DataViewComponent.BOTTOM_RIGHT);

        <b>//Add detail views to the component:</b>
        dvc.addDetailsView(new DataViewComponent.DetailsView(
                "Hello World Details 1", null, 10, panel, null), DataViewComponent.TOP_LEFT);
        dvc.addDetailsView(new DataViewComponent.DetailsView(
                "Hello World Details 2", null, 10, panel, null), DataViewComponent.TOP_RIGHT);
        dvc.addDetailsView(new DataViewComponent.DetailsView(
                "Hello World Details 3", null, 10, panel, null), DataViewComponent.BOTTOM_RIGHT);
        dvc.addDetailsView(new DataViewComponent.DetailsView(
                "Hello World Details 4", null, 10, panel, null), DataViewComponent.BOTTOM_RIGHT);

        return dvc;

    }
    
}</pre>
            
            <p><li>Right-click the project node and choose "Run".
            This will install the plugin in a new instance of VisualVM
            and you'll see your new tab, for all application types:
            
        <p><p><img src="{{ '/images/final-result.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" border="1"/>
            
        </ol>
        <p>Congratulations you have completed the Hello World scenario!
        
        <h2><a name="trouble"></a>Troubleshooting</h2>
        
        <p>If the instructions for the Hello World sample, as described above,
        do not work for you, do the following:
        
        <ol>
        <li>Use the "Download Sample" link at the top of this page to
        download the sample.
        <p><li>Install the downloaded NBM file into NetBeans IDE via Tools | Plugins | Downloaded.
        <p><li>Open the New Project wizard (Ctrl-Shift-N) and find
        the sample in the Samples | NetBeans Modules category, as
        shown here:
        <p><p><img src="{{ '/images/trouble-1.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" border="1"/>
        <p><li>Complete the wizard and, if you have not set VisualVM as
        your NetBeans Platform, you will see the project, together with
        some error badges, as shown here:
        <p><p><img src="{{ '/images/trouble-2.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" border="1"/>
        <p><li>Choose Tools | NetBeans Platforms, click Add Platform, and browse to the installation
        folder of VisualVM, to register it:
        <p><p><img src="{{ '/images/trouble-3.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" border="1"/>
        <p>Click Next and then click Finish.
        <li>Right-click the "HelloVisualVM" project node in the Projects window
        and choose Properties. In the Libraries panel, choose VisualVM as your
        NetBeans Platform. When you close the Project Properties dialog, the
        error marks should no longer be present.
        <li>Run the project, and the result should be the same as the last step
        of the previous section.
        </ol>  
        <p>Now inspect the sources of the sample and compare them to your own
        to see where the problem is.
        
        <h2><a name="wizard"></a>Appendix A: VisualVM File Templates</h2>
        
        <p>The NetBeans Plugin Portal provides wizards that you might find
        helpful when getting started extending VisualVM:
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://plugins.netbeans.org/PluginPortal/faces/PluginDetailPage.jsp?pluginid=6503">VisualVM View Template.</a>
             Gives you the Java classes needed for creating a new tab for a specified
             data source, together with the applicable
             project dependencies.</li>
            <li><a href="http://plugins.netbeans.org/PluginPortal/faces/PluginDetailPage.jsp?pluginid=6664">VisualVM Application Type Template.</a>
            Gives you the Java classes needed for VisualVM to recognize a new Java application, via

        <p>To continue learning about the VisualVM APIs, you are
        recommended to consult the following resources:
        
        <ol>
            <li><b>Get the VisualVM Javadoc.</b> API documentation for VisualVM 1.3.7
            can be found <a href="nonav/apidocs/137/index.html">here</a>.</li>
            <li><b>VisualVM Developer FAQ.</b> A <a href="api-faq.html">complete list of typical questions</a>
            that can be asked in relation to the VisualVM APIs, together with many code
            samples that answer them.
            <li><b>VisualVM Sources.</b> If you read the VisualVM sources, you will
            be able to answer several of your API implementation questions. For example,
            you can find several pluggable views in the sources that you can learn from
            when creating your own pluggable views. 
            <li><b>VisualVM Plugins.</b> When you download the VisualVM
                sources, you will find that you have also downloaded the sources
                of a set of plugins. You can inspect these plugins and learn
                from them. Treat them as samples. At the time of writing, the plugins bundled
                with the sources are as follows:
                <p><ul>
                    <li><b>GlassFish.</b> This plugin provides a new application
                        type for the GlassFish server. A new application type node
                        is created for each running GlassFish instance. All deployed
                        applications are represented by subnodes, with further subnodes
                        for each servlet in the application. Furthermore, tabs specific
                        to each server instance, application, and servlet are also
                    provided.</li>
                    <li><b>MBeans.</b> This plugin provides a new tab for all
                    applications that have JMX enabled. The information provided
                    in the tab is exactly the same as the information provided by
                    the MBeans tab in the JDK's JConsole application.
                    <li><b>JConsole.</b> This plugin makes VisualVM receptive
                    to JConsole plugins, so that investment in JConsole plugins is
                    not lost when you transfer from JConsole to VisualVM.

            <li><b>Blog entries by Geertjan Wielenga.</b> Geertjan is
                the technical writer responsible for documenting the VisualVM APIs.
                While learning about the VisualVM APIs, he wrote a series of blog
                entries about the VisualVM APIs he was learning about. 
                
                <p><b>Note:</b> Several APIs have changed since these blog entries
                were written, but they should at least give you an idea of what
                is involved in each particular scenario described.
                <p>The relevant
                blog entries are as follows:

                    Here you create your first tab extension. You discover that VisualVM
                    tabs are broken down into master views, master view configurations,
                    and detail views. That blog entry is reproduced in the "Hello World"
                    section of this tutorial.

                    Here you create an application type extension, with a subtab
                    extension within the Overview tab and a menu extension, both specifically 
                    for the application type.

                    Here you are introduced to application type subnodes and you
                    are referred to the GlassFish plugin for related source code.

                    Here the extendability of the "Overview" tab, "Monitor" tab, and "Threads" tab
                    are highlighted. In addition, you are shown how to make your own tabs
                    extendable.

                    Here the extendability of the "Host" data source is discussed. Code is provided
                    for adding a tab to the Localhost view and a subtab to its Overview tab.

                    Here you find out how to create a tab for comparing data from multiple instances of the same data source type.
                    In this case, the tab contains the system properties (or JVM arguments)
                    of all the running Java applications, at the same time.
