        <h1>VisualVM Developer FAQ</h1>
        
        <p>This is the developer-oriented FAQ for VisualVM. Developer in this context means 
        "person writing plugins for VisualVM". 
        
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        
        <h3><a name="what-status"></a>What's the current status of the VisualVM APIs?</h3>
        
        <p>Under development. You are free to create plugins but you must realize that
        there will definitely be non-compatible changes in the coming months. However,
        all such changes will be clearly documented at the time of the related release.
        
        <h3><a name="how-to-start"></a>How do I get started extending VisualVM?</h3>
        
        <p>Read <a href="{{ '/api-quickstart.html' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Getting Started Extending VisualVM</a>,
        which gives you some background information about VisualVM extensions, shows you how to
        set up your environment, walks you through a "Hello World" scenario, and gives you
        an overview of all the VisualVM public packages.
        
        <h3><a name="where-javadoc"></a>Where is the VisualVM Javadoc?</h3>
        
        <p>See <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">https://{{ site.baseurl }}</a>.
        
        <h3><a name="only-netbeans"></a>Do I have to use NetBeans IDE to extend Visual VM?</h3>
        
        <p>No. However, NetBeans IDE provides wizards and templates for VisualVM plugin development,
        while other IDEs do not (currently) have this kind of support.
        
        <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
        
        <h3><a name="what-is-lifecycle"></a>What is the lifecyle of a VisualVM plugin?</h3>
        
        <p>A plugin's life begins when it is installed into VisualVM. It can be installed
        through the VisualVM Plugin Manager (accessed from the Tools menu) or when you run
        it from NetBeans IDE.
        
        <p>The entry points implemented in a plugin must be initialized in a
        class that extends <tt>org.openide.modules.ModuleInstall</tt>. They must also
        be uninstalled through that class. Initialization occurs in the
        <tt>ModuleInstall.restored</tt> method and uninstallation through the
        <tt>ModuleInstall.uninstalled</tt> method. 
        
        <p>Every example of VisualVM extension points includes
        an example of the entry points initialization and uninstallation,
        such as in the
        <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/entry/getting_started_extending_visualvm_part">Getting Started Extending VisualVM</a> document.
        
        
        <h3><a name="what-about-layer"></a>What about the <tt>layer.xml</tt> file?</h3>
        
        <p>If you have created modules on top of the NetBeans Platform before,
        you will be aware of a configuration file called <tt>layer.xml</tt>. This file is
        used to initialize entry points into the NetBeans Platform. However, the APIs that
        are specific to VisualVM
        do not use this approach. Instead, they use the <tt>org.openide.modules.ModuleInstall</tt> class,
        as described above.
        
        <p>However, since VisualVM is based on the NetBeans Platform, VisualVM is able to
        reuse several
        of the NetBeans Platform APIs. For example, VisualVM reuses the NetBeans APIs responsible for
        providing the main menubar's menu items and 
        the main toolbars and toolbar buttons. Therefore, you will need to use the
        NetBeans Actions API when you want to add new menu items and toolbars
        to VisualVM. The
        NetBeans Actions API makes use of the <tt>layer.xml</tt> file and, therefore,
        in this case you would make use of the <tt>layer.xml</tt> file after all. However,
        if you're using NetBeans IDE, you would simply use the "New Action" wizard and then
        the wizard would populate the <tt>layer.xml</tt> file for you. If you have questions
        about the NetBeans Platform APIs, see the <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/NetBeansDeveloperFAQ"> NetBeans Developer FAQ</a>.
        
        <h2>Data Sources</h2>
        
        <h3><a name="what-is-datasource"></a>What is a <tt>DataSource</tt>?</h3>
        
        <p>A data source is the primary actor in the VisualVM APIs. Everything that happens
        in VisualVM happens in relation to a data source. 
        
        <p>The most important data source from the user's perspective is the <tt>Application</tt>
        data source. This data source represents the applications that are monitored and managed
        in VisualVM. The other existing data sources exist to support the <tt>Application</tt>
        data source.
        
        <p>In VisualVM, each node in the explorer view (on the left of the application) is
        provided by a data source (and its supporting classes).
        
        <h3><a name="default-datasource"></a>What are the default <tt>DataSource</tt>s?</h3>
        
        <p>The following are the default data sources:
        
        <ul>
            <li>AbstractApplication
            <li>AbstractCoreDump
            <li>AbstractDataSource
            <li>AbstractHeapDump
            <li>AbstractHost
            <li>AbstractSnapshot
            <li>AbstractThreadDump
            <li>Application
            <li>CoreDump
            <li>DataSource
            <li>DataSourceContainer
            <li>DataSourceProvider
            <li>DataSourceRepository
            <li>DataSourceRoot
            <li>DefaultDataSourceContainer
            <li>DefaultDataSourceProvider
            <li>HeapDump
            <li>Host
            <li>Snapshot
            <li>ThreadDump
        </ul>
        
        <h3><a name="why-create-datasource"></a>Why would I create a new <tt>DataSource</tt>?</h3>
        
        <p>Possibly, you want the user to be able to monitor, troubleshoot, or manage a source
        of data that VisualVM does not provide support for out of the box. In fact, VisualVM is
        simply a tool for displaying data, so you could create one or more of the following
        data sources:
        
        <ul>
            <li>Photo
            <li>ShoppingList
            <li>Task
            <li>Reminder
        </ul>
        
        <p>However, VisualVM is created specifically for monitoring, troubleshooting,
        and management purposes. Therefore, you are more likely to want to create new
        data sources that relate specifically to these purposes. In general, the need to
        create a new data source is likely to arise in only a very small number of cases.
        
        <h3><a name="how-create-datasource"></a>How do I create a new <tt>DataSource</tt>?</h3>
        
        <p>A <tt>DataSource</tt> object is defined when you extend these classes:
        
        <ul>
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.datasource.AbstractDataSource
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.datasource.DefaultDataSourceProvider
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.model.dsdescr.DataSourceDescriptor
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.model.AbstractModelProvider
        </ul>
        
        <p>A complete example can be found <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/entry/getting_started_extending_visualvm_part4">here</a>.
        In addition, you can read the VisualVM sources, because all the predefined
        data sources are defined there.
        
        <h2>Views</h2>
        
        <h3><a name="what-is-view"></a>What is a view?</h3>
        
        <p>A view in VisualVM consists of a tab and one or more subtabs, displayed
        in the main application area when "Open" is chosen on a data source in the explorer
        view.
        <ul><li>A <b>tab</b> is, for example, "Overview", "Monitor", and "Threads".
            <li>A <b>subtab</b> is, for example, "JVM Arguments" and "System Properties", within
        the "Overview" tab.</ul>
        
        <h3><a name="how-create-tabs"></a>How do I create new views (tabs, pluggable tabs, subtabs)?</h3>
        
        <p>You create new <b>tabs</b> by extending these classes:
        
        <ul>
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.DataSourceView
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.DataSourceViewProvider
        </ul>
        
        <p>A complete example for creating new tabs can be found <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/entry/getting_started_extending_visualvm">here</a>.
        
        <p>To make your tabs extendable, the following API must be extended:
        <ul><li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.PluggableViewSupport</ul>
        
        <p>A complete example for creating pluggable view can be found <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/entry/getting_started_extending_visualvm_part2">here</a>.
        
        <p>You create new <b>subtabs</b> by extending these classes:
        
        <ul>
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.ViewPlugin
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.ViewPlugin.ViewDescriptor
        </ul>
        
        <p>A subtab can only be added to a tab if the tab is created to
        be pluggable, that is, only if the tab makes use of <tt>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.PluggableViewSupport</tt>.
        In the cases of the predefined tabs in VisualVM, you need to initialize
        the support class that relates to the pluggable view that you want to extend:
        
        <ul>
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.dataview.monitor.MonitorViewSupport
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.dataview.overview.OverviewViewSupport
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.dataview.threads.ThreadsViewSupport
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.heapdump.HeapDumpSupport
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.threaddump.ThreadDumpSupport 
        </ul>
        
        <p>A complete example for adding a subtab to the "Overview" tab can be found <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/entry/getting_started_extending_visualvm_part">here</a>.
        
        <h3><a name="how-layout-view"></a>What components can I use to design my view?</h3>
        
        <p>The VisualVM APIs provides a set of components that make
        it easy for you to integrate your tools into VisualVM:
        
        <ul>
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.components.DataViewComponent.MasterView
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.components.DataViewComponent.MasterViewConfiguration
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.components.DataViewComponent.DetailsView
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.components.DataViewComponent.DetailsAreaConfiguration
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.components.DataViewComponent.DisplayArea
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.components.DataViewComponent.ScrollableContainer
        </ul>   
        
        <p>A complete example that works with most of the VisualVM ui components can
        be found in the
        <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/entry/getting_started_extending_visualvm_part">Getting Started Extending VisualVM</a> document.
        
        <h2>Application Types</h2>
        
        <h3><a name="what-apptype"></a>What is an application type?</h3>
        
        <p>An application type is a model that you need to create when you
        want VisualVM to cater to a new type of application. For example, the
        GlassFish plugin creates a new application type for applications that
        have <tt>com.sun.enterprise.server.PELaunch</tt> as their main class. Since that
        is the main class of the GlassFish application server, the application type
        is created whenever an instance of GlassFish is started. 
        
        <h3><a name="default-apptype"></a>What are the default application types?</h3>
        
        <p>The following are the predefined application types:
        
        <ul>
            <li>DefaultApplicationType
            <li>JavaPluginApplicationType
            <li>JavaWebStartApplicationType
            <li>MainClassApplicationType
            <li>NetBeans3xApplicationType
            <li>NetBeansApplicationType
            <li>NetBeansBasedApplicationType
            <li>VisualVMApplicationType
        </ul>
        
        <h3><a name="why-create-apptype"></a>Why would I create my own application types?</h3>
        
        <p>You would create your own application type if you have an application that
        you want VisualVM in a special way. By default, the <tt>DefaultApplicationType</tt>
        will be used to handle your application. However, if your application is a deployment
        server, you probably want to display nodes for deployed applications
        as subnodes to the application node in the explorer view. In this case, you would need
        to model a new type of application and then create it via a factory class. Most
        typically, as done in the case of GlassFish, your factory class would create
        your application type if a started application has a main class that matches
        the main class defined in the application type implementation.
        
        <h3><a name="how-create-apptype"></a>How do I create my own application types?</h3>
        
        <p>You create new application types by extending these classes:
        
        <ul>
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.model.apptype.ApplicationType
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.model.apptype.ApplicationTypeFactory
        </ul>
        
        <p>A complete example for creating a new application type can be found <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/entry/getting_started_extending_visualvm_part">here</a>.
        
        
        <h3><a name="how-create-subnodes"></a>How do I add subnodes to my application type?</h3>
        
        <p>to be done
        
        <h3><a name="how-add-menu-items"></a>How do I add contextual menu items to my application type?</h3>
        
        <p>You create new contextual menu items by extending these classes:
        
        <ul>
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.explorer.ExplorerActionsProvider
            <li>javax.swing.AbstractAction
        </ul>
        
        <p><b>Note:</b> If a <tt>DataSourceViewProvider</tt> returns true from the <tt>supportsViewFor()</tt> method, 
        an "Open" menu item is automatically created for you, as explained <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/entry/getting_started_extending_visualvm_part4">here</a>. 
        
        <p>A complete example for creating new menu items can be found <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/entry/getting_started_extending_visualvm_part">here</a>.
        
        <h3><a name="how-add-menu-items-sub"></a>How do I add contextual menu items to my application type's subnodes?</h3>
        
        <p>to be done
        
        <h2>Hosts</h2>
        
        <h3><a name="what-is-host"></a>What is a host?</h3>
        
        <p>The <tt>Host</tt> class provides the common interface 
        for data sources that represent a localhost or remote host. It is a data source,
        just like <tt>Application</tt> is a data source. However, it is not as important
        to the end user as the <tt>Application</tt> data source. By default, VisualVM
        provides a tab per host, showing host-specific information, such as CPU and
        memory statistics, as well as the host IP and operating syste,.
        
        <h3><a name="how-extend-host"></a>How do I add additional views for the Host data source?</h3>
        
        <p>You create new tabs for the Host data source by extending these classes:
        
        <ul>
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.DataSourceView
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.DataSourceViewProvider&lt;Host&gt;
        </ul>
        
        <p>A complete example for creating new tabs 
        for the Host data source can be found <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/entry/getting_started_extending_visualvm_part3">here</a>.
        
        
        <h3><a name="how-extend-host-overview"></a>How do I extend the Host "Overview" tab?</h3>
        
        <p>You create new tabs for the Host data source by extending these classes:
        
        <ul>
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.ViewPlugin.ViewDescriptor
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.ui.ViewPlugin&lt;Host&gt;
        </ul>
        
        <p>A complete example for creating new tabs 
        for the Host data source can be found <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/entry/getting_started_extending_visualvm_part3">here</a>.
        
        
        <h2>Enabling/Disabling Functionality</h2>
        
        <h3><a name="ensure-jmx"></a>How do I ensure that the application has JMX enabled?</h3>
        
        <p>Possibly, you only want a view to be shown if JMX is enabled.
        For this reason, you have two classes at your disposal:
        
        <ul>
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.model.jmx.JmxModel
            <li>com.sun.tools.visualvm.core.model.jmx.JmxModelFactory
        </ul>
        
        <p>Use your <tt>DataSourceViewProvider.supportsViewFor</tt> like this for these purposes:
        
<p><pre>public boolean supportsViewFor(Application application) {
    JmxModel jmx = JmxModelFactory.getJmxModelFor(application);
    MBeanServerConnection mbsc = jmx.getMBeanServerConnection();
    return mbsc != null;
}</pre>

<p>If <tt>false</tt> is returned, JMX is not enabled and the view will not be shown.

        <h2>Distribution</h2>
        
        <h3>How do I distribute my VisualVM plugins?</h3>
        
        <p>If you use NetBeans IDE to create your VisualVM plugin, you can
        right-click the project and choose "Create NBM". This gives you an NBM
        file, which is a ZIP file that VisualVM understands. That NBM file can
        be installed into VisualVM via the Plugin Manager. You can distribute your
        NBM file via e-mail or by putting it on a server and telling your users
        where to get it. You can also create something called an "update center", which
        is an XML file defining your NBM file's location and description, which your
        users can register in their Plugin Manager and which they can then use to
        access your VisualVM plugins.
