        <h1>Working with Remote Applications</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>VisualVM is able to access and display data about applications running on remote hosts.
        After connecting to a remote host, VisualVM can display general data about the application's runtime environment
        and can monitor memory heap and thread activity.</p>
        <p><b>Note.</b> VisualVM can retrieve monitoring information on remote applications but it cannot 
        profile remote applications. </p>

        <h3>Connecting to a Remote Host</h3>
        <p>Connected remote hosts are displayed as nodes under the Remote node in the Applications window.
        When you are connected to a remote host, VisualVM displays applications running on the host as sub-nodes,
        and automatically updates the status of the remote applications, removing the applications when they
        stop and adding applications when they start.</p>
        
        <p>To add a remote host, right-click the Remote node in the Applications window, choose Add Remote Host and type the host name or IP address in the Add Remote Host dialog box.
        (You can also specify a display name that will be used to refer to the host when listed under the Remote node.)</p>

        title="Add Remote Host dialog box" />
        <p><b>Note:</b> To retrieve and display information on applications running on the remote host, the <tt>jstatd</tt> utility
        needs to be running on the remote host.
        To start the <tt>jstatd</tt> utility, type jstatd on the command line.
        The <tt>jstatd</tt> utility is included as part of Java Development Kit (JDK) version 6.
        For more on <tt>jstatd</tt>, see the following document:</p> 
        <ul><li><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/share/jstatd.html">jstatd - Virtual Machine jstat Daemon</a></li></ul>
       
        <p>When VisualVM is connected to a remote host, a node for the remote host appears under the Remote node
        in the Applications window. 
        You can expand the remote host node to view the applications running on the remote host.</p>

        title="Remote node in Applications window showing application running on remote host" />
            
            
        <h3>Viewing Application Data</h3>
        <p>VisualVM displays data about each running remote application in a dedicated tab in the main window.
        To open the application tab, right-click the application node in the Applications window and choose Open.
        (Alternatively, you can double-click the application node.)
        When you click Open, the Overview tab of the application tab opens in the main window.</p>
        
        <img src="{{ '/images/remote-overview.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="border:1px solid;" alt="Overview tab of remote application" 
        title="Overview tab of remote application" />
       
        <p>You can use the sub-tabs in the application tab to view details about the application.<br/>
