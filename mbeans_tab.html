        <h1>MBeans Tab</h1>
        <hr />
        <p> An optional VisualVM plug-in exists that adds   Java Management Extensions (JMX) monitoring and management capabilities to VisualVM. This plug-in is the <em>MBeans</em> <em>tab</em>, which allows you to access all the JMX technology MBeans that are present in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This page provides a brief introduction to the JMX technology and to MBeans, and then introduces the VisualVM MBeans tab itself.</p>
        <h2>JMX Technology and MBeans </h2>
        <p>The JMX technology is a standard part  of the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE platform). The JMX technology provides a simple, standard way of managing  resources such as applications, devices, and services. Because the JMX  technology is dynamic, you can use it to monitor and manage resources  as they are created, installed and implemented. In addition, instrumentation is provided with the Java SE platform that allows you to use the  JMX technology to monitor and manage the JVM software. </p>
        <p>Using the JMX technology, a given resource is instrumented by one or more Java objects known as <em>Managed Beans</em>, or <em>MBeans</em>. These MBeans are registered in a core-managed object server, known as an <em>MBean server</em>.  The MBean server acts as a management agent and can run on most devices  that have been enabled for the Java programming language.</p>
        <h3>Platform MBeans </h3>
        <p>The <em>platform MBeans</em> are a set of MBeans that is provided  with the Java SE platform for monitoring and managing the JVM software and  other components of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Each platform  MBean encapsulates an aspect of the JVM software's functionality, such as the  class-loading system, just-in-time (JIT) compilation system, garbage  collector, and so on. These MBeans can be displayed and interacted  with by using a monitoring and management tool that complies with the  JMX specification, to enable you to monitor and manage these different  VM functionalities. One such monitoring and management tool is VisualVM. </p>
        <p>The Java SE platform provides a standard <em>platform MBean server</em> in which these platform MBeans are registered. The platform MBean  server can also register any other MBeans you wish to create. </p>

        <h2>Adding the MBeans Tab Plug-In</h2>
        <p>To access the MBeans running in a given JVM software instance via VisualVM, you need to install the MBeans tab plug-in. To do so, take the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Select 'Tools' then 'Plugins' in the VisualVM drop-down menus. You will see the following window. 
        <p>  <img src="{{ '/images/plugin-window.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="VisualVM Plugin Window" width="840" height="556" /></li>
        <li>Check 'VisualVM-MBeans' and click 'Install'. </li>
        <li>Step through the on-screen  instructions.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now, if you highlight a running Java application, right-click, and then select 'Open', you will see the MBeans tab in VisualVM's right-hand window. If VisualVM is already monitoring a running application, in order for the MBeans tab to appear, you will need to close the tab for the monitored application in VisualVM's right-hand panel and then re-start the monitoring by right-clicking on the application and selecting 'Open' again. </p>
        <p><img src="{{ '/images/vvm-mbeans-tab.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="VisualVM's MBeans tab" width="902" height="592" /></p>
        <h2>Displaying MBeans in VisualVM</h2>
        <p>The MBeans tab displays information about all the MBeans registered with the platform  MBean server. The MBeans tab allows you to access  the full set of the platform MBean instrumentation. In addition, you can monitor and manage your  own applications' MBeans using the MBeans tab.</p>
        <img src="{{ '/images/mbeans-tab.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="The JConsole MBeans tab."/>
        <p>The tree on the left shows all the MBeans that are currently running. When  you select an MBean in the tree, tabs are displayed on the right hand side to allow you to view the MBean's attributes, operations, notifications and metadata, as shown in the figure above. These tabs will be examined in more detail in the following sections. </p>
        <p>All the platform MBeans and their various 
        <attributes>
        attributes, operations, notifications, and  metadata are accessible via  the MBeans tab. The figure above shows the attributes of the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/management/MemoryMXBean.html">Memory</a> platform MBean. </p>

        <h3>Constructing the MBean Tree</h3>
        <p>By default, the MBeans are displayed in the tree based on their  object names. The order of key properties specified when the object names are  created is preserved by the MBeans tab when it adds MBeans to the MBean tree.  The exact key property list that the MBeans tab will use to build the MBean  tree will be the one returned by the method <span class="style1">ObjectName.getKeyPropertyListString()</span>, with <span class="style1">type</span> as the  first key, and <span class="style1">j2eeType</span>, if present, as the second key.</p>
        <p>However, relying on the default order of the <span class="style1">ObjectName</span> key properties can sometimes  lead to unexpected behavior when the MBeans tab renders the MBean tree. For example, if  two object names have similar keys but their key order differs, then the  corresponding MBeans will not be created under the same node in the MBean  tree.</p>
        <p>For example, suppose you create Triangle MBean objects with the following names.</p>
        <pre>com.sun.example:type=Triangle,side=isosceles,name=1  
        com.sun.example:type=Triangle,name=2,side=isosceles  
        com.sun.example:type=Triangle,side=isosceles,name=3</pre>
        <p>As far as the JMX technology is concerned, these objects will be  treated in exactly the same way. The order of the keys in the  object name makes no difference to the JMX technology. However, if VisualVM connects  to these MBeans and the default MBean tree rendering is used, then the  object <span class="style1">com.sun.example:type=Triangle,name=2,side=isosceles</span> will end up being created under the <span class="style1">Triangle</span> node, in a  node called <span class="style1">2</span>, which in turn will contain a sub-node called <span class="style1">isosceles</span>. The  other two <span class="style1">isosceles</span> triangles, <span class="style1">name=1</span> and <span class="style1">name=3</span>, will be grouped together under  <span class="style1">Triangle</span> in a different node called <span class="style1">isosceles</span>, as shown below.</p>
        <img src="{{ '/images/mbean-tree1.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Example of Unexpected MBean Tree Rendering" height="240" width="194" />
        <p>To avoid this problem, you can specify the order in which the  MBeans are displayed in the tree by supplying an ordered key property list. You can set the ordered key property list by selecting VisualVM's Tools | Options menu, and clicking on the MBeans button, as shown below.</p>
        <p><img src="{{ '/images/mbeans-options.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="MBeans options menu"/></p>
        <p>The key property list system property takes a comma-separated list of keys, in  the order of your choosing, where each key must be a string representing an  object name key or an empty string. If a key specified in the  list does not apply to a particular MBean, then that key will  be discarded. If an MBean has more keys than the ones specified in  the key property list, then the key order defined by the value returned  by <span class="style1">ObjectName.getKeyPropertyListString()</span> will be used to complete the key order you define in the Ordered Key Property List field. Therefore, specifying an empty list of keys simply means that VisualVM will  display keys in the order they appear in the MBean's <span class="style1">ObjectName</span>.</p>
        <p>So, returning to the example of the Triangle MBeans cited above, you could chose to configure VisualVM so that all  your MBeans will be grouped according to their <span class="style1">side</span> key property first, and  their <span class="style1">name</span> key property second. To do this, you would add the following in the Ordered Key Property List field in the MBeans tab of the Tools | Options menu: </p>
        <p><img src="{{ '/images/key-prop-list.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Setting the Key Property List" width="538" height="79" /></p>
        <p>If you restart the application, the MBeans will now show up in VisualVM's MBeans tree as shown in the following figure. </p>
        <p><img src="{{ '/images/mbean-tree2.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Example of MBean Tree Constructed Using keyPropertyList" height="239" width="194" />

        <p>As you can see, the <span class="style1">side</span> key comes first, followed by the <span class="style1">name</span> key. The  <span class="style1">type</span> key comes at the end because it was not specified in the  key property list, so the MBean tree algorithm applied the original key order  for the remaining keys. Consequently, the type key is appended at the end, after  the keys which were set in the MBeans options menu.</p>
        <p>According to the object name convention defined by the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/best-practices-jsp-136021.html">JMX Best Practices Guidelines</a>, the <span class="style1">type</span>  key should always come first. So, to respect this convention you should set the following key property list. </p>
        <p><img src="{{ '/images/key-prop-list2.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Setting the key property list in accordance with JMX best practices" width="539" height="74" /></p>
        <p>Setting the  above key property list will cause VisualVM to render the MBean tree for  the Triangle MBeans as shown below. </p>
        <img src="{{ '/images/mbean-tree3.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Example of MBean Tree Constructed Respecting JMX Best Practices" height="228" width="196" />
        <p>This is obviously much more comprehensible than the first two MBean trees shown in this section.</p>


        <h2>MBean Attributes</h2>
        <p>Selecting the Attributes tab displays all the attributes of an MBean. The following figure  shows all the attributes of the <span class="style1">Threading</span> platform MBean.</p>
        <img src="{{ '/images/mbean-attribs.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Viewing the attributes of the Threading MBean."/>
        <p>You can display additional information about an attribute by double-clicking on the attribute  value, if it appears in bold text. For example, if you click on  the value of the <span class="style1">HeapMemoryUsage</span> attribute of the <span class="style1">java.lang.Memory</span> MBean, you will  see additional information about the attribute, as shown below.</p>
        <img src="{{ '/images/attrib-values.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Viewing the values of MBean attributes."/>
        <p>Double-clicking on numeric attribute values will display a chart that plots changes in  that numeric value. For example, double-clicking on the <span class="style1">CollectionTime</span> attribute of the  Garbage Collector MBean  <span class="style1">MarksweepCompact</span> will plot the time spent performing garbage collection.</p>
        <p><img src="{{ '/images/attrib-plotting.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Plotting changes in an attribute value."/></p>
        <p>You can also use VisualVM to set the values of writable attributes. The  value of a writable attribute is displayed in blue. Here you can  see the <span class="style1">Memory</span> MBean's <span class="style1">Verbose</span> attribute.</p>
        <img src="{{ '/images/mbean-writeable-attrib.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Setting an MBean's writable attribute value." />
        <p>You can set attributes by clicking on them and then editing them.  For example, to enable or disable the verbose tracing of the  garbage  collector in VisualVM, select the <span class="style1">Memory</span> MBean in the MBeans tab and set  the Verbose attribute to <span class="style1">true</span> or <span class="style1">false</span>. Similarly, the class loading MBean also  has a Verbose attribute, which can be set to enable or disable class  loading verbose tracing.</p>
        <h2>MBean Operations</h2>
        <p>Selecting the Operations tab displays all the operations of an MBean. The MBean  operations appear as buttons, that you can click to invoke the operation. The figure  shows all the operations of the <span class="style1">Threading</span> platform MBean.</p>
        <img src="{{ '/images/mbean-ops.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Viewing the Threading platform MXBean's operations."/>
        <p>The image below shows the result of clicking on the <span class="style1">dumpAllThreads</span> button to invoke the corresponding option. </p>
        <p><img src="{{ '/images/operation-done.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Result of performing a thread dump." width="465" height="312" /></p>
        <h2>MBean Notifications</h2>
        <p>You can subscribe to notifications from MBeans by selecting the Notifications tab, and clicking the Subscribe button at the bottom of the main pane. The  number of notifications received is displayed in square brackets, and the Notifications node  itself will appear in bold text when new notifications are received. The notifications  of the <span class="style1">AnagramsStats</span>  example MBean from the <a href="https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/java/jmx-tutorial.html">JMX NetBeans Tutorial</a> are shown in the figure below.</p>
        <img src="{{ '/images/mbean-notifs.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Viewing an MBean's notifications." />
        <h2>MBean Metadata</h2>
        <p>An MBean's metadata, or <span class="style1">MBeanInfo</span>, is displayed by the Metadata tab. This includes information like the MBean's object name, class name, a brief description,  and Descriptor information. The Metadata tab also shows the MBean's <span class="style1">MBeanAttributeInfo</span>. The Metadata tab for the <span class="style1">Memory</span> platform MBean is shown below.</p>
        <p><img src="{{ '/images/mbean-metadata.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" /></p>
        <h2>HotSpot Diagnostic MBean</h2>
        <p>VisualVM's MBeans tab also allows you to tell the HotSpot VM to  perform a heap dump, and to get or set a VM option via  the <span class="style1">HotSpotDiagnostic</span> platform MBean.</p>
        <img src="{{ '/images/mbean-hotspot.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Performing heap dumps using the HotSpot VM Diagnostic MBean."/>
        <p>You can perform a heap dump manually by invoking the <span class="style1">com.sun.management.HotSpotDiagnostic</span> MBean's  <span class="style1">dumpHeap</span> operation.  In addition, you can specify the <span class="style1">HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError</span> Java VM option using  the <span class="style1">setVMOption</span> operation, so that the VM performs a heap dump automatically whenever  it receives an <span class="style1">OutOfMemoryError</span>.</p>
